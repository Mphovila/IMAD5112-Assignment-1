Report

The report below will detail the background, objective, purpose of the app, its design consideration, and the utilisation of GitHub and GitHub action. The "History App" will ask the user for their age and compares it to the ages of historical famous people who have passed away. 

Background 
Your family's close friend, Sarah, has heard about your talent for creating mobile apps and needs your expertise to develop a special Android mobile application. Sarah is an avid history buff and educator who wants to use technology to inspire young minds. She envisions an Android app that compares users' ages to famous figures from history. Sarah believes that this app will not only be educational but also fun for students. 

 Objective: 
This app will take a person's age as input and then match the age to the age of different people in history when they passed away. Additionally, you'll set up version control with GitHub and implement GitHub Actions for automated testing and building to ensure a robust and maintainable application.

Purpose:
The purpose of the app is to educate students about historical people lifespans and will help students dive deeper into the lives of historical people and their achievements by comparing ages.

Design consideration:
The design of the History App will focus on simplicity, usability, and accessibility. The app will consist of a user-friendly Interface with a single input field for the user's age, a generate history button to match the user to a historical figure and a clear button that will reset app back to start. 
The History App will be accessible to all users who are over the age of 20 but not older than 100 years old.  A reliable database of historical figures and their ages at death will be used on the app. Kotlin will be the language used to code the history app.

Utilisation of GitHub:
I will be using GitHub because GitHub tracks changes made to the codebase, allowing us to go back to previous work, which is essential to keep the app functional. GitHub also helps when it comes to collaboration because different developers can work on one project and the platform also provides a bug tracking feature.


GitHub Action:
GitHub Action would benefit the history app by automating the build process, which would compiling code, generating documentation, and deploying the app to a testing environment.

Picture on the history app:

There is a main page on top of the app which is a front cover of a book called HISTORIANS ON HISTORY by JONH TOSH published November 14, 2017, by Routledge
